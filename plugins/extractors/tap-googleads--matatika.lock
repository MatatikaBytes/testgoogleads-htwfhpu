  "description": "Google Ads is an online advertising platform that allows businesses to create and display ads to potential customers.\n\nGoogle Ads, formerly known as Google AdWords, is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising platform that enables businesses to create and display ads to potential customers when they search for specific products or services on Google. Advertisers bid on specific keywords and pay for each click on their ads, with the cost per click (CPC) varying depending on the competition for the keyword. Google Ads also offers a range of targeting options, including location, demographics, and interests, allowing businesses to reach their ideal audience. Additionally, Google Ads provides detailed analytics and reporting, allowing advertisers to track the performance of their ads and make data-driven decisions to optimize their campaigns.\n### Prerequisites\nTo obtain the required settings for connecting to Google Ads, follow these steps:\n\n1. OAuth identity provider authorization endpoint used to create and refresh tokens: This endpoint is specific to the identity provider you are using. You can find this information in the documentation provided by the identity provider.\n\n2. OAuth scopes we need to request access to: The required OAuth scopes depend on the specific actions you want to perform in Google Ads. You can find a list of available scopes in the Google Ads API documentation.\n\n3. Access Token: To obtain an access token, you need to authenticate with Google using OAuth 2.0. Once you have authenticated, you will receive an access token that you can use to make API requests. You can find more information on how to obtain an access token in the Google Ads API documentation.\n\n4. OAuth Refresh Token: The refresh token is obtained during the initial authentication process and is used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires. You can find more information on how to obtain a refresh token in the Google Ads API documentation.\n\n5. Developer Token: The developer token is a unique identifier that is used to track API usage and ensure compliance with Google Ads policies. You can obtain a developer token by creating a Google Ads account and registering for the API.\n\n6. Customer Id: The customer ID is a unique identifier for each Google Ads account. You can find your customer ID in the Google Ads UI or by using the Google Ads API.",
